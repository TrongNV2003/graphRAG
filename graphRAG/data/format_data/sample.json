We should think about these PDFs having two layers – one layer \nis the image and a second layer is the text. The image layer shows what the document will look \nlike if it is printed to paper. The text layer is searchable text that is carried over from the original \nWord file into the new PDF file (the technical term for this layer is “extracted text”). There is no \nneed to make it searchable and the new PDF will have the same text as the original Word file. An \nexample of True PDFs that federal defenders and CJA panel attorneys will be familiar with are \nthe pleadings filed in CM/ECF. The pleading is originally created in Word, but then the attorney \neither saves it as PDF or prints to PDF and they file that PDF document with the court. Using \neither process, there is now a PDF file created with an image layer plus text layer. In terms of \nusability, this is the best type of PDF to receive in discovery as it will have the closest to text \nsearchability of the original file. \n \n",
